# Home Runs vs. Hits (per year) Analysis

In this report, we will be analyzing the relationship between home runs (HR) and hits (H) in Major League Baseball from 1970 to 2014. We will use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship and perform linear regression to quantify it.

The scatter plot of HR vs. H shows a positive relationship between the two variables; showing a r-value for the relationship between HR and H is 0.977. 

Based on the scatter plot and regression analysis, we can conclude that there is a strong positive relationship between home runs and hits in Major League Baseball from 1970 to 2014. This means that as the number of hits increases, the number of home runs is also expected to increase. The regression line provides us with a way to quantify this relationship and make predictions about the number of home runs based on the number of hits. The equation of the regression line is HR = 0.22 * H + (-21087.37), which tells us that for every one unit increase in H, HR is expected to increase by 0.22. The constant term (-21087.37) in the equation represents the expected value of HR when H = 0. Overall, these results suggest that hits play an important role in determining the number of home runs in Major League Baseball.
